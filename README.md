# text_editor
Simple python based text editor

This is a text editor that I pieced together from different functionality that I found on the internet.  

This has very basic functionality, but does allow the following:
- Read and write text files
- Font selection for text area
- Ability to change text and background color
- Some basic copy/paste functionality
- The ability to export to pdf and specify the output font(limited) and file name.

This has been a learning project for me and I'm open to feature requests and improvements.  
If you find a bug, please open an issue and I will try to figure out how to fix it.

If you would like to see different functionality, put a comment on the release and I will try to add it.

If you know a better way that I should do something, let me know.  I'm always looking for ways to improve.

Again, this is a learning project.
